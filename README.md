Hello! My name is BenThePerson! I am learning to code and design games in order to make the game I always dreamed of making!
I learned c++, but not how to really put it to use which I am currently looking into. I know java as well as a bit of python too but
it's the same idea of not knowing real world applications for them.
  
I'm looking to build my experience with c++ mainly by making a thing or two and looking at examples of real world use.
If for some reason you wish to contact me, you can reach me at my email bentheperson101@gmail.com
